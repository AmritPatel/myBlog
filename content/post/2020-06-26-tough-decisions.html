<p>After hearing about the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in Nepal over the past 2 weeks<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and given that the uptick in cases is very delayed compared to most of the rest of the world, I wanted to see how Nepal’s new cases per day density trajectory stacked up to other countries.</p>
<p>I figured I would do my own analysis and present the results here for posterity, but I found a lot of great work already done providing open access to not only data, but really good interactive graphs. Like this one.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>We are also at a kind of crossroads. Our Thai visas are about to expire in about a month at the end of July and we will soon be faced with a decision to return to Nepal or return to the U.S., our home country. We will be leaving a country that has amongst the lowest number of per capita cases<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> to go to one that is amongst the highest. The plot below on a log scale illustrates this point well.</p>

<p>Currently, comparing Nepal to the U.S. shows that there is nearly 10x the density of new daily cases <em>at the country level</em>. These numbers are alarming as it stands and makes our decision to return to Nepal a lot easier. Nepal’s relatively slow but steady rise is also troubling, but what to do with imperfect information?</p>
<p>Things get scarier when you look at state-level data – like with our home state of Florida where the growth of cases is the second worst in the world currently at ~2.7k new cases per day per million people.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> That is to say, Florida is literally off the chart.</p>
