## Summary of the Student Project

A "customer" is requesting a blog assessing the state of Kathmandu air pollution. Students teams will design, create, and publish a website based on research and original data analysis for a customer by integrating 21st century technology development skills.

During this project students will demonstrate mastery of the following competencies[^1] [[rubric]](http://www.quickrubric.com/r#/qr/amritpatel/website-project):

  1. Presentation *(of website)*
    + Motivation for website
    + Design and building experience
    + Discuss features
    + Discuss feedback received/given
    + Used Rmarkdown-based presentation hosted on GitHub Pages
  1. Revisions *(via GitHub)*
    + Teams assess each other by providing student feedback through GitHub's social features[^2]
    + Edit/proofread others' work commenting and providing constructive suggestions for changes
    + Teams incorporate changes as desired and can justify why they were or were not incorporated
  1. Publishing *(to GitHub)*
    + Register a new domain for website (setup Netlify w/ GitHub)
    + Build and deploy (when changes to website are made)
  1. Creating *(a website)*
    + Create original data analysis using `tidyverse` package
    + Create a new project in RStudio using `blogdown` package
    + Incorporates (and improves upon as needed) previously completed and submitted coursework
  1. Designing *(a website)*
    + Create an effective project outline.
    + Divides responsibilities amongst team:
        - Project manager
        - Marketing
        - User experience
        - Technical    
  1. Programming *(can use the Rmarkdown and R languages appropriately and effectively)*
    + Basic formatting techniques (e.g., bold/italics, headings, footnotes)
    + Code blocks to show R code
    + Citations
    
[^1]: The competencies are shown in reverse chronological order because they were developed using the [backward planning](https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/features/reverse-planning-can-help-students-reach-goals/) strategy.
[^2]: Teacher will also provide constructive feedback.

## Student Monitoring and Feedback

Since GitHub is a service that is open to the public by default, this will allow access to both students and teachers to monitor and provide feedback. This is also a unique opportunity for students to learn how to conduct themselves in a public forum.

Teams will suggest changes to other teams' projects via GitHub "pull requests".

![***Pull Requests***](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/repo-tabs-pull-requests.png)

The teams will communicate and provide feedback with each other using GitHub's advanced commenting features such as inline commenting.

Teams will be expected to consider each others' feedback, responding back to all suggestions exlpaining why teams agree or disagree with suggestions.

Using GitHub as the platform to publish student projects, several things are accomplished.

### For Students

  - Authentic learning is promoted by using a real-world design environment.[^3]
  - Students showcase a self-inspiring portfolio of work![^4]
  - Students learn to give and receive feedback.
  - Students develop [meta-cognitive skills](https://lincs.ed.gov/state-resources/federal-initiatives/teal/guide/metacognitive) through feedback sessions.
  
### For Teachers

  - Can freely monitor and provide direct feedback to students.
  - Student work can be directly assessed.

[^4]: Excellent student work could even serve as a demonstration to a future prospective employer exemplifying the ability to develop a functional product while working on a collaborative design team!
