<p>The following figure is a simple illustration of how students can be grouped based on abilities using <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmritPatel/myBlog/master/content/resources/algebra1Period3.csv">sample assessment data</a>. Assessment scores have been averaged for each student with 1-<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> standard deviations shown as a way to measure student score consistency.</p>

<p>Paired with the figure above, the figure below can be used to quickly identify trends for a given student by looking at performance on various assignment categories (i.e., homework, projects, quizzes, reviews, and tests). Comparing scores on homework and projects versus performance on summative assessments can be a useful indicator of student engagement or determination. For example, Student 2271 performed well on the test and test review, but didn’t do as well on homework and the project – this student may be bored or disengaged. Another example is Student 2562, who performed well on homework and the project, but not as well on the test and test review – this student might be determined to do well by completing individual assignments, but may be struggling to tie these individual concepts together.</p>

<h2>Creating Mixed Student Groups of Varying Abilities and Talents for a Particular Lesson</h2>
<p>For a future lesson involving groups, I would use the data from Figure 1 to create groups with a variety of abilities allowing stronger students to help out students not performing as well or who are disengaged. I would do this by having an approximatley equal number of students from each of the 4 quantiles,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> indicated in Figure 1, in a group. Increasing group diversity may also have a positive impact on idea creation by avoiding “groupthink”, which is a positive attribute to this strategy.</p>
