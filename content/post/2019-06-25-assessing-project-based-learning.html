<h2>Summary of the Student Project</h2>
<p>A “customer” is requesting a blog assessing the state of Kathmandu air pollution. Students teams will design, create, and publish a website based on research and original data analysis for a customer by integrating 21st century technology development skills.</p>
<p>During this project students will demonstrate mastery of the following competencies<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="http://www.quickrubric.com/r#/qr/amritpatel/website-project">[rubric]</a>:</p>

<h2>Student Monitoring and Feedback</h2>
<p>Since GitHub is a service that is open to the public by default, this will allow access to both students and teachers to monitor and provide feedback. This is also a unique opportunity for students to learn how to conduct themselves in a public forum.</p>
<p>Teams will suggest changes to other teams’ projects via GitHub “pull requests”.</p>

</div>
<p>The teams will communicate and provide feedback with each other using GitHub’s advanced commenting features such as inline commenting.</p>

<p>Using GitHub as the platform to publish student projects, several things are accomplished.</p>
