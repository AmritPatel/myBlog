<h1>Pinning down lap-level running data.</h1>
<p>Having to login to the Garmin Connect website and manually download running data in <code>.csv</code> format is starting to get pretty annoying. Searching for a more automated solution, I found a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Garmin/comments/f6v5ye/is_there_an_api_for_your_data_on_garmin_connect/">post on Reddit</a> that pointed me to a <a href="https://github.com/tcgoetz/GarminDB">GitHub repo</a> containing a convenient command-line utility that allows me to download all of my Garmin lap-level activity data directly to binary <code>.fit</code> files. It worked like a charm.</p>
<p>There is also an activity-level SQLite database file available that links the <code>.fit</code> files named based on a unique <code>activity_ID</code> number to a descriptive activity name. In this case, I am trying to isolate all runs named “Vadhana Running” for this particular analysis, so the database is useful to screen activity IDs.</p>
<p>The next problem was that the <code>.fit</code> data needed to be converted to <code>.csv</code> format. Luckily, I managed to find a <a href="https://maxcandocia.com/article/2017/Sep/22/converting-garmin-fit-to-csv/">blogger</a> describing a utility they built to do just this, which sent me to another <a href="https://github.com/mcandocia/examples/blob/master/convert_fit_to_csv/convert_fit_to_csv.py">GitHub repo</a> containing a <code>Python</code> script that gets the job done.</p>
<p>After running the <code>Python</code> script on the running activities of interest on my computer locally outside of <code>R</code>, I was ready to import the data for plotting building on my <a href="https://amritpatel.rbind.io/2020/03/27/100-lap-challenge/">previous post</a>.</p>

<h1>Calculating heat index.</h1>
<p>In my next post, I want to take a look at heat limited running pace. For that analysis, I would like to experiment with using heat index data to develop a simple model relating heat index and heat limited running pace. And, for heat index data, I will need relative humidity data. Unfortunately, this is not included in the <code>.fit</code> files or other downloadable data files that I could find. But, this data is embedded in the map object on the Garmin Connect website. So I am able to manually add it in.</p>
<p>Heat index is calculated using a function from the <code>weathermetrics</code> library that calculates the heat index based on the <a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/html/heatindex_equation.shtml">NOAA algorithm</a>.</p>

<p>And now lap data can be easily plotted by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Running <code>download_create_dbs.sh</code><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> to generate a local database of all Garmin activity data and bypassing manual login to the Garmin Connect website.</li>
<li>Simply converting any number of <code>.fit</code> files of interest to <code>.csv</code> format using <code>convert_fit_to_csv.py</code>.</li>
<li>Performing a little automated post-processing in R to setup a dataframe with variables of interest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Plotting the lap data from all of the Vadhana runs is now simple by re-using the plotting code from a recent related post.</p>

<p>And finally, a summary plot of all my Bangkok late Spring 2020 runs at the Vadhana fixed track I used as my training ground.</p>
