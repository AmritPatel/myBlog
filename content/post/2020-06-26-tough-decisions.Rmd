After hearing about the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in Nepal over the past 2 weeks[^1], and given that the uptick in cases is very delayed compared to most of the rest of the world, I wanted to see how Nepal's new cases per day density trajectory stacked up to other countries.

[^1]: The current estimate is ~11,000 cases as of this writing at ~17.41 new cases per 1 million people per day (7-day rolling average) from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus).

I figured I would do my own analysis and present the results here for posterity, but I found a lot of great work already done providing open access to not only data, but really good interactive graphs. Like this one.[^5]

[^5]: Assuming this it is still up and running as you are viewing this webpage.

We are also at a kind of crossroads. Our Thai visas are about to expire in about a month at the end of July and we will soon be faced with a decision to return to Nepal or return to the U.S., our home country. We will be leaving a country that has amongst the lowest number of per capita cases[^2] to go to one that is amongst the highest. The plot below on a log scale illustrates this point well.

[^2]: There have been nearly no cases originating *from within* Thailand since its peak.

Currently, comparing Nepal to the U.S. shows that there is nearly 10x the density of new daily cases *at the country level*. These numbers are alarming as it stands and makes our decision to return to Nepal a lot easier. Nepal's relatively slow but steady rise is also troubling, but what to do with imperfect information?

Things get scarier when you look at state-level data -- like with our home state of Florida where the growth of cases is the second worst in the world currently at ~2.7k new cases per day per million people.[^3] That is to say, Florida is literally off the chart.
