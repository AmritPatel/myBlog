      <description>With today’s students, technology and computers have surrounded them and often been an influential part of their lives. Some may have had free access to tinker around with computers of various sorts (e.g., cell phones, tablets, personal computer) and have shown a great deal of interest while others may not have had the same access or shown the same level of interest.
For these reasons, before the Introduction to Computer Programming unit, I have chosen to first gauge students’ familiarity working with a personal computer (or laptop) system – specifically with the ability to download, install, and open the integrated development environment (IDE) that we will be using extensively throughout the computer programming class.</description>

      <description>The following figure is a simple illustration of how students can be grouped based on abilities using sample assessment data. Assessment scores have been averaged for each student with 1-\(\sigma\) standard deviations shown as a way to measure student score consistency.
Figure 1. Student grouping based on performance.
Paired with the figure above, the figure below can be used to quickly identify trends for a given student by looking at performance on various assignment categories (i.</description>

      <description>Summary of the Student Project A “customer” is requesting a blog assessing the state of Kathmandu air pollution. Students teams will design, create, and publish a website based on research and original data analysis for a customer by integrating 21st century technology development skills.
During this project students will demonstrate mastery of the following competencies1 [rubric]:
Presentation (of website)  Motivation for website Design and building experience Discuss features Discuss feedback received/given Used Rmarkdown-based presentation hosted on GitHub Pages  Revisions (via GitHub)  Teams assess each other by providing student feedback through GitHub’s social features2 Edit/proofread others’ work commenting and providing constructive suggestions for changes Teams incorporate changes as desired and can justify why they were or were not incorporated  Publishing (to GitHub)  Register a new domain for website (setup Netlify w/ GitHub) Build and deploy (when changes to website are made)  Creating (a website)  Create original data analysis using tidyverse package Create a new project in RStudio using blogdown package Incorporates (and improves upon as needed) previously completed and submitted coursework  Designing (a website)  Create an effective project outline.</description>
