      <description>After hearing about the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in Nepal over the past 2 weeks1, and given that the uptick in cases is very delayed compared to most of the rest of the world, I wanted to see how Nepalâ€™s new cases per day density trajectory stacked up to other countries.
I figured I would do my own analysis and present the results here for posterity, but I found a lot of great work already done providing open access to not only data, but really good interactive graphs.</description>
