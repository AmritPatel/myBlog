      <description>Building off of my last post, after several setbacks over 3 days, I finally managed to hack together a function that generates the RPI and heat limited pace related plots of my previous posts all from the comfort of a RStudio chunk.
First off, for the life of me I couldn’t figure out how to run a Python script from within R using the reticulate package. I spent hours to get this to work.</description>

      <description>Plot heat limited running pace and a sample of my average running pace data vs. temperature and humidity. I obtained heat limiting pace data from fellrnr.com to see if my body would naturally self-limit pace based on intense heat.
I wanted to spot check some of my running data taken during pretty intense heat in Bangkok while I was there during late Spring 2020.</description>

      <description>Pinning down lap-level running data. Having to login to the Garmin Connect website and manually download running data in .csv format is starting to get pretty annoying. Searching for a more automated solution, I found a post on Reddit that pointed me to a GitHub repo containing a convenient command-line utility that allows me to download all of my Garmin lap-level activity data directly to binary .fit files. It worked like a charm.</description>

      <description>Just like that, the 100 lap challenge is over. On my next try, I completed 100 sweltering laps. What surprised me was how tired I was at the outset from not getting enough sleep the night before. I guess it really shows what you can do if you put your mind toward something.
I noticed that something’s up with Lap 50 as the RPI is unusually high.

      <description>After implementing the running performance index (RPI) in my previous post, I was curious to know what my RPI was using ALL the data I had available, which I found goes back to 2009!
Using more or less the same process as documented in the previous post, I import all of my available running data for runs that were greater than or equal to 3 miles and that were not run on a treadmill.</description>

      <description>Having recently hunkered down in Bangkok for the foreseeable future,1 in an apartment building with a closed gym,2 I wondered what kind of exercise routine I could establish.
Playing with my son in the courtyard a couple days in, I somehow got the idea of jogging a few laps around the makeshift track formed by the walking pathway – despite a heat index over 100 degrees F!
Having not run in months3, I took the opportunity to challenge myself to keep going.</description>
