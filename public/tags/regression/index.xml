      <description>After implementing the running performance index (RPI) in my previous post, I was curious to know what my RPI was using ALL the data I had available, which I found goes back to 2009!
Using more or less the same process as documented in the previous post, I import all of my available running data for runs that were greater than or equal to 3 miles and that were not run on a treadmill.</description>

      <description>Having recently hunkered down in Bangkok for the foreseeable future,1 in an apartment building with a closed gym,2 I wondered what kind of exercise routine I could establish.
Playing with my son in the courtyard a couple days in, I somehow got the idea of jogging a few laps around the makeshift track formed by the walking pathway â€“ despite a heat index over 100 degrees F!
Having not run in months3, I took the opportunity to challenge myself to keep going.</description>
