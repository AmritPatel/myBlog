      <description>Over our recent 5 month stay in Thailand we happened to acquire a jump rope. For most of the time it collected dust. Now that I’ve picked it up again I’m thinking the reason was because jumping rope is actually pretty challenging. On multiple levels.
There is the whole timing the rope turns in sync with your jumping, which stimulates brain activity and as crossrope.</description>

      <description> Here I am compiling a set of heat training data1 to assess whether “violation” of an established heat limited pace2 has a noticeable impact on running performance index as defined in a previous post.
 From runs in Thailand during the summer of 2020.↩
 See Heat limited running pace. post for more details.↩

      <description>After hearing about the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in Nepal over the past 2 weeks1, and given that the uptick in cases is very delayed compared to most of the rest of the world, I wanted to see how Nepal’s new cases per day density trajectory stacked up to other countries.
I figured I would do my own analysis and present the results here for posterity, but I found a lot of great work already done providing open access to not only data, but really good interactive graphs.</description>
